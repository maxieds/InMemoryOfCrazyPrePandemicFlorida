# Prepared disclosure to accompany message to the US congressional January 6th committee

**NB, this post and the information contained (linked) therein WILL most certainly piss off a lot of people.**
Some of this information may inadvertently contain personally identifable information 
about otherwise innocent people. That artifact is not my fault. Because of my limited resources to report this 
information more discretly, including to authoritative persons where I work that have 
apparently acted with intent to suppress and censor this message, 
I am acting on my gut instinct to just do my best to make the data available here. 
A link to this post (in order of importance by recency in time) sent to the US congressional January 6th committee 
is forthcoming. Since I have been out here in the US southwestern desert, and especially since my first meetings with 
coworkers that each have questionable identities and motives, I have been drugged so badly that most days I am barely 
able to walk when I am able to get out of bed at all. 
*This all feels very surreal and I am very uncomfortable right now.*

## Immediate concerns

After I started on mandatory counter-intelligence training 1-2 weeks ago, I stopped in the middle of a scenario 
to disclose events that had happened to me while I was here for my interview earlier this year to my local direct superior (manager). 
Namely, a hotel employee had been overly firendly to me, repeatedly offered me free items like water, sleeping pills and 
wine, and given me his business card to visit him at the local Native American Heritage Museum. 
I was unable to sleep the three day entirety of my interview until I entered the pressurized cabin of the airplane to 
take me back to my home across the country. While I was on the ariforce base for my interview, I became extremely disoriented 
due to what the personell described as altitude sickness, though I was offered no medical treatment nor were the 
assigned employees anything but hostile and dismissive  about dangers to my physical health-- 
even mocking me about how long these severe symptoms would last if I accepted the position (one taunting 6-8 months at most). 
After I arrived here to move, one local I had mentioned my new workplace to shouted '*Los Alamos!*' at me to let me know 
where I was actually geographically located. 
*I have to wonder how long there has been a cyber-security branch of this famous national laboratory in this state 
(especially after muted warnings at my initial training sessions by HR representatives about how sketchy the incoming proposition is)?*

My multiple attempts at obtaining a federal clearance for my work have been blocked and delayed repeatedly since the middle of 
August, 2022. The most recent notice I have seen (strangely, CC'ed to my former university email address) stated that my manager 
would have to petition for the most recent clearance application revoked this week on grounds of past-due incompleted actions 
that were not my responsibility to move forward. To move forward, I will also have to reissue my urine sample for a mandatory 
drug screening test to proceed. This is after interactions with my local physician stating that I need to see a mental health 
doctor approved by my workplace to write standard prescriptions I fill every month were very awkward to take part in. 
Text (SMS) messages responding to my manager about these unusual circumstances led him to forward them to a workplace medical 
provider with concerns about my mental health. 
*It is plain to see and infer what the expected course of action will be if I do not speak up publicly as soon as I am able.*

## Labor day weekend of 2022 -- and following attempts to cover-up or supress information by federal employees

Over Labor Day weekend (2022) I started investigating the source of substantial financial fraud and 
identity theft using my name and sensitive personal credentials. This led me to discover many online 
caches of data (binary and web-based) much of which I believe is restricted to the realm of the 'dark web'. 
I reported my experience the next day to coworkers affiliated with my new workplace while severely 
disoriented and dehydrated from the night before. Since disclosing the findings to a superior I believed (at the time) 
to be authoritative, the computer data (screenshots, webpage sources in full, binary APK data, and other miscellania) 
has been substatially modified / tampered with / censored / deleted on my hard drive. That night, I had 
access to (to the best of my perceptive ability) a historically inaccurate snapshot of saved data on my mobile phone. 
This data allowed me to view (some the of the images partially censored or partially '*classified*' even) information about 
past headlines. There was location information available only about the photograph of my COVID-19 vaccination 
records -- which is very distrurbing to me and perhaps others. 
I was also able to view a headline about former US vice preseident, Mike Pence, 
taking (claiming) control of the country (IIRC) on March 15, 2015. I wrote down the exact date in pen on a sticky note 
for future reference (since I suspected at the time the phone contents would later be redacted or non-viewable). 
That note kept in my personal locked residence has since been replaced by another dated 2020 with a headline 
about Mike Pence confirming President Biden to the US presidency. 
*A key takeaway from my experience is that there is an active effort to censor and supress my experience not 
only in its electronic forms (i.e., on my workstation) but also by modifying records kept in my personal 
belongings offsite from work.*

I contacted my coworkers the next day over text message to report my panicked reaction. One of them (male) 
picked me up at my residence in his car. He started the conversation by directing me to tell him what I 
thought (perceived) had happened. He stated that some of what I saw online vis a vis 
Elon Musk and efforts to send innocent Americans to Mars and Mark Zuckerberg's VR (virtual reality) 
META-conception with an offensive dancing goofy mock headset sounded (to him) like '*QANON*' (Bannon). 
I pointed out that the cached binaries of Fox News (and related) applications for Android/iOS/AppleWatch devices 
had some strange signatures on the apparent (targeted) '*versions*' including some posted in Arabic language. 
This, I recall mentioning at the time, might be important to report further because of possible dark-web-type 
organization in recent events by the terrorist organization, al Qaeda. After I said that and mentioned to him 
that the location on my mobile phone had changed far out of state to Texas the night before led him to 
instruct me to turn off my phone so that the location of his home would not be tracked. He then stopped to 
run up the mountains to fetch me water for the '*post-truth-serum-like*' severe dehydration I was going through 
(lest I end up dead, certainly a more severe crime to cover up and explain in the near future). 
The next time I checked my records (weeks later, as I 
was severely physically ill for weeks after that), the unusual geo-location-type barcode that accompanied 
the Arabic langauage posters version of the software was missing from my computerized records. 
The first few (most recent) postings of the Fox News application that I saved were missing from my records as well. 
This makes me wonder if the Eastern European names of the signatures (with barcodes) are somehow tied to the 
ongoing war between Russian and the Ukraine?

Both coworkers escorted me to a bench outside the location of my workplace office where ants quickly started 
crawling all over me (presumably an artifact of the sweet smelling drug I had been illicitly 'slipped' the night before). 
Neither of them had access to the building interior at the time. The male coworker repeatedly asked me if I had the 
ability to get on the (abandoned) airforce base nearby for them to meet about disclosing these events 
(I did, but was uncomfortable doing so that day without an escort). 

## Other talking points for later

My exhaustion leads me to only abbreviate notes about things that I wanted to write down in much more verbose detail:

* Events viewed on my SmartTV during the insurrection (events at the capitol on January 6-7, 2021) -- Neo-nazis and violent hate group involvement is being grossly undercovered and misrepresented on all mainstream media outlets -- I lived nextdoor with a direct fiber-optic connection (no sattelite delays or censorship) to the large Turner Broadcasting HQ building where I was able to view snippets of live video from the events streaming in the middle of the night
* Oragnization of the CNN-termed 'insurrection' happened on Twitter with millions of followers on private channels 
* Apple Watch -- unlocks phones for medical claims -- medical fraud -- idea that everyone is employed in this time of economic recession
* Personal experience related to all this -- more recent rise of anti-Semitism in America
* 'MineCraft' (e.g., XXX/RPG type markings on prescriptions and medications (more todo documents later) -- Files / signed PDFs documents prepared with ominous context about timelines and payments from sources that paid for illicit druggings 
* The drug 'amphetamine sulfate' is a form of the illegal street drug methamphetamine, IIRC, correct?
* Is 'LOTUS' a reference (possible threat) using a Chinese symbol of death?
* Why was Emmanuel Goldstein particularly disgusted (more so than usual) discussing extensions and prefixes of US phone numbers on a pandemic-era episode of *Off the Hook* I listened to on Spotify?
* ML: Warren bumper sticker on car to celebrate COVID in 2020?
* Boondocks DVD: (I honestly believe that) My mother was physically assaulted, sexually assaulted, and then murdered (passed before her time) over her and my religion -- '*I'm sorry about your mother.*' (ML -- last conversation threat days before I had any notice of her sudden transition to hospice care in late April of 2022 -- the same weekend as my first scheduled job interview mentioned above)
* Neurorights -- Pet peeve of mine (historically, and very recently for reasons that are easily inferred from context)
